# Marksmania !!

Hi everyone, this is just a little project that I made as my final assignment for Code in Place 5! Hope you like it. 
It's a simple target shooting game. You have 30 seconds to strike as many targets as possible!
Red targets award you 100 points, Blue targets 300 points, and Golden targets award you 500 points! Beware though, for
as the Blue targets fall to the ground and the Golden ones teleport around! 

Requires tkinter, PIL, pygame.

I will soon upload a video of the gameplay :)
